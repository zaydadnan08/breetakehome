Super simple app, just some screens and UI -> was not able to commit as much time as I wanted to this 
Did not implement logic though have wifi check 

Overall Idea: 
If no wifi, store request locally as pending, when wifi available check for any pending requests and make req 
Only store at max 1 pending request, if make a new request replace old pending request 

Code Sharing: 
Components and styles can be copied to react, have generic global styles to keep consistency throughout app 
Most UI can be copied over for react, just backend functionality which may be different 

Plan for storage: 
For smaller apps I normally use Context API, though would need something more robust depending on data ex: redux
Storage Async storage or sqllite would be sufficient. 

Other react native apps I releaased: https://apps.apple.com/sa/developer/zayd-adnan/id1755440896 
(mostly for fun)
